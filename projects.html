            <h2><a href="https://github.com/yourusername"  style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Toxicity Prediction in SMILES</a></h2>
            <p>This project predicts the toxicity of chemical compounds using machine learning. Utilizing the Tox21 dataset, it extracts molecular descriptors from SMILES strings with RDKit and applies SVM, KNN, and Random Forest models for classification. Performance is evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.
                The project highlights expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, with applications in chemical safety, environmental research, and drug discovery. </p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/yourusername"  style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Optimizing Diagnostic Decision Support Using Pre-Pruned Decision Trees</a></h2>
            <p>Developed a project is based an optimized Decision Tree Classifier with pruning algorithms helps to predict disease presence by taking
                symptoms of a person as input.
                A dataset of 350 entries is used to train the model, achieved 71.5% accuracy, evaluated with a classification report.</p>

            <p>Developed a two-step biometric authentication system using OpenCV (face recognition) and SpeechRecognition (voice password) with MySQL integration.
                Captured 20 face samples per user and stored a unique voice password for authentication. 
                Implemented LBPH face recognition and speech verification, allowing 20 authentication attempts for secure access.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/yourusername"  style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Based Detection of Synthetic Audio Deepfakes</a></h2>
            <p>Developed a deepfake audio detection system using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to
                classify audio as real or fake.
                The project involved extracting MFCC features, training an HMM to model temporal patterns, and evaluating the model using accuracy
                and confusion matrix metrics, achieving 85% accuracy. The model was trained on about 60 audio recordings.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/yourusername"  style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Health Advisory Application</a></h2>
            <p>Developed a real-time health monitoring application integrating Gradio and Pathway for data visualization and analysis. Designed a simulated data pipeline generating key health metrics (heart rate, steps, calories, sleep hours) stored in a structured format.
                Implemented a streaming architecture to ensure seamless data flow to the frontend. Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pathway for enhanced AI-driven recommendations.
                Built and deployed the system within a WSL-based virtual environment, optimizing efficiency and scalability</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/yourusername"  style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Analyzing DNA Pathways and Their Impact on Cancer Development</a></h2>
            <p>Implimeted project utilizes a Neo4j graph database containing 107 cancer genomes to analyze gene interactions and visualize them in a
                clear, structured format.It integrates graph theory (using NetworkX) with gene interaction data, providing a comprehensive tool to
                explore relationships between genes.
                By employing graph traversal algorithms such as BFS and DFS, it efficiently explores gene networks, while its mutation analysis offers
                valuable insights into how gene alterations impact biological pathways.
